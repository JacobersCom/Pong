# Pong

I made this game for fun because I was bored one day and wanted to stop using game engines to make my own games, so I took a leap of faith and learned how to make pong.


## Demo
 ![Pong](D:/ScreensShots/pong.png)

The game does not start till the user presses 1, than the ball will begin to move to the top right of the screen.

The left paddle can be moved with W and S, while the right paddle can move with I and J.

The first play to have the play move off of THEIR SIDE OF THE SCREEN loses.

That my friends is pong.
